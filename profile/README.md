<h3>What is CBD?</h3>
<p>CBD, short for cannabidiol, is a natural compound found in the hemp plant. Unlike THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), CBD is non-psychoactive, meaning it does not produce a "high." Over the years, CBD has been studied extensively for its potential health benefits, and the results have been promising.</p>
<p>CBD interacts with the body&rsquo;s endocannabinoid system (ECS), which plays a crucial role in regulating many bodily functions, such as mood, sleep, pain sensation, and immune response. By promoting balance in the ECS, CBD has shown promise in helping with various issues, such as anxiety, chronic pain, inflammation, and sleep disorders.</p>
<h3>Benefits of CBD</h3>
<p>CBD is known for its numerous health benefits, and many individuals are turning to it as a natural remedy. Here are some of the key advantages of incorporating CBD into your daily routine:</p>
<h4>1. <strong>Stress and Anxiety Relief</strong></h4>
